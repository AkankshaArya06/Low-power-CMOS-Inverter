 # Abstract
 
 Low power devices have become increasingly popular in recent years. This rapid proliferation is specifically because of fast increase of battery-operated transportable devices including laptop, tablet PC . Semiconductor devices are scaled to achieve high performance and excessive integration density. Due to elevated density of transistors in a die, the power consumption in a die is increasing . Supply voltage is scaled to balance the power consumption within limits.
New low power techniques are required to reduce overall power in high performance nanoscale circuits.
This paper introduces a inverter technique i.e. CMOS inverter and one another approach i.e. reduce Swing approach CMOS inverter



# Introduction


A CMOS inverter is consist of a pmos  and an nmos devices. Its operation can be understood with a easy transfer version of the MOS transistor, the transistor is nothing greater than a transfer with an countless off resistance When input is logic 0, logic 1 is obtained at the output and when input is logic 1, logic 0 is observed at the output. Fig.1 shows the conventional CMOS approach.
The CMOS inverter has two important advantages over the other inverter configuration
