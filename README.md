 # Abstract
 
 Low power devices have become increasingly popular in recent years. This rapid proliferation is specifically because of fast increase of battery-operated transportable devices including laptop, tablet PC . Semiconductor devices are scaled to achieve high performance and excessive integration density. Due to elevated density of transistors in a die, the power consumption in a die is increasing . Supply voltage is scaled to balance the power consumption within limits.
New low power techniques are required to reduce overall power in high performance nanoscale circuits.
This project introduces a inverter technique i.e. CMOS inverter and one another approach i.e. reduce Swing approach CMOS inverter



# Introduction
As we know the high performance circuit needs the large number of transistor with high speed. But this improvement in the performance comes with power dissipation. And high
package density becomes the one the major demand in VLSI technology, the size of transistor is getting reduced. As the technology is getting finer, the percentage of leakage power dissipation in total power dissipation is increases significantly
